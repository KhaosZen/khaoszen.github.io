### 2.How to build a documentation website
+ HTML: Essential Structure;
	+ HTML stands for **H**yper **T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage
	+ HTML describes the **structure** of Web pages using markup
	+ HTML elements are the **building blocks** of HTML pages
	+ HTML elements are represented by **tags**	+ HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on	+ Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to **render** the content of the page
+ CSS: Page design;
	+ CSS stands for **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets	+ CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media	+ CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once	+ **External stylesheets** are stored in CSS files
+ JS: Page behavior;

+ However, I use the Markdown language with Jeckyll Sever (Easy to config and easy to handle).

### 3.How I Built My Own Website
+ Go to [Github](https://www.github.com) and register an Github account.
+ Login and create a new repository in my Github and name it [username].github.io.(May be this [link](https://pages.github.com/) would help.)
+ Build my pages all on my own or use the help of **Jekyll** to build a static websige by using the [**Markdown Language**](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
+ Following the tutorials from the Internet and finish the Website building.
