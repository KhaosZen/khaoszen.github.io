## Soldering
### Exercise: Solder Our Own Shanghaino Board

+ Socket * 1
+ CRYSTAL * 1
+ CAP 22pF * 2
+ CAP 0.1uF * 3
+ CAP 10uF * 1
+ RES 10kOhm * 1
+ RES 220Ohm * 2
+ Green LED * 1
+ Red LED * 1
+ Power Connector * 1
+ 8 - PIN FEMALE HEADER * 2
+ 6 - PIN FEMALE HEADER * 3
+ Arduino Pro-like Microcontroller

#### Solder it up!

Some problems should be noticed:  
+ Solder the units one by one is highly recommended
+ Heat the board and the inserted units by the weilding head and make sure the temperature between board and the unit are almolstly the same and then put the solder near the junction point of two materials to solder.
+ Some of the copper on the PCB board may be oxidized, and there will be a open circuit if we don't add up some solder on it. So check the circuit connectivity by the multimeter's Ohmmeter, if open circuit happens, add the solder on the board!
